### Aim :
      To pick and place a regular shape using two finger gripper on the conveyor belt 
### Equipment Required: 
      Instrial manipulator , teach pendant and associated program platform , two finger dh gripper 
      
### Theory: 

A pick and place robot has several dedicated parts, such as:

Robot Arm tool: A robotic arm, also known as a manipulator, is the extension of the robot by using cylindrical or spherical parts. links, and joints.

End Effector: The end effector is the accessory at the end of the robotic arm, that does the required job such as gripping objects. The end effectors can be designed to perform different functionalities based on requirements.

Actuators: Actuators create the motion in the robotic arm and end effectors. The linear actuators are basically any type of motor, such as servo motor, stepper motor, or hydraulic cylinder.

Sensors: You can think of sensors as the eyes of the robots. The sensors do the tasks like identifying the position of the object.

Controllers: Controllers synchronize and control the movement of different actuators of a robot, thereby being the brain behind the smooth robotic operation.


### Two finger gripper 

DH-Robotics
Adaptive Gripper AG-95 TM Kit
The AG-95 adaptive gripper is designed for multi-purpose gripping applications and can pick objects in different sizes and shapes without changing the end-of-arm tools, with a large stroke and adjustable gripping force. It’s also easy-to-use due to seamless integration with TM collaborative robots.

Through a plug-in installed in the TM flow, user could easily get full access to the control of gripper, including position and force control, as well as gripping detection. With such functions, DH-Robotics AG-95 gripper improves the gripping and manipulating capability of robots used in different scenarios such as machine tending, electronics/automobile components handling, medica, etc.
